## Key Testing Patterns Implemented

### 1. Fixture-Based Testing
```python
@pytest.fixture
def calculator(self):
    return PokemonAvailabilityCalculator()
```
- Reusable test data and objects
- Reduces code duplication
- Ensures consistent test environment

### 2. Parameterized Test Data
```python
restrictions = {'A': [1, 2, 3]}
evo_id_pp_list = ["1_1_50", "2_1_50", "3_1_50"]
```
- Clear, readable test data
- Easy to extend for more test cases

### 3. Edge Case Coverage
- Empty DataFrames
- Null/NaN values
- Missing columns
- Zero damage scenarios
- Floating-point precision

### 4. Boolean Assertion Fixes
Changed from `assert x is True` to `assert x == True` to avoid numpy/pandas boolean comparison issues.

- Mathematical correctness of damage calculations
- Proper battle simulation logic
- Correct party optimization algorithm
- Accurate data filtering and normalization

This solid test foundation enables confident refactoring, feature additions, and maintenance of the optimization pipeline.
